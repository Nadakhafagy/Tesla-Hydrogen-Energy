# Tesla: Hydrogen Production & Energy Conversion 🔋
**Recycling aluminum by-products to produce clean hydrogen fuel and electrical energy.**

---

### 📌 Project Overview
Egypt faces a growing energy crisis and waste management challenges. This project provides a dual solution: recycling aluminum waste to produce **Hydrogen (H₂)** via a chemical reaction, then converting that hydrogen into thermal and electrical energy.

### 🧪 Chemical Synthesis
The core of the project is the reaction between Aluminum (Al) and Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH):
$$2Al + 2NaOH + 6H_2O \rightarrow 2Na[Al(OH)_4] + 3H_2$$

*   **Input:** 27g Al + 40g NaOH + 54ml $H_2O$.
*   **Yield:** Successfully produced 3 Liters of Hydrogen in prototype testing (Theoretical yield: 67.2L).

### 💻 Thermodynamic Simulation
To ensure safety and efficiency, we utilized advanced simulation tools to model the energy output:
*   **Software:** Gaussian, Avogadro, and **EES32**.
*   **Calculated Work Net ($w_{net}$):** 244 kJ/kg.
*   **Turbine Analysis:** Modeled gas expansion and compression ratios ($B_c = 16.1$).

### 🚀 Prototype Results
1. **Chemical Stage:** Verified H₂ production using the "squeaky pop" ignition test.
2. **Conversion Stage:** Used a heat-exchange system to boil water.
3. **Electrical Stage:** Steam-driven turbine (fan) powered a motor, producing **1.5V** to light an LED bulb.

### 🛠️ Materials & Tools
- **Chemistry:** NaOH, Aluminum Foil, Conditioning Water.
- **Hardware:** Glass Pyramid, Turbine Fan, DC Motor, Capillary Hose.
- **Analysis:** Thermodynamic modeling and stoichiometric calculations.
